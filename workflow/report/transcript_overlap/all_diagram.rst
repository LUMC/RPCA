A Venn diagram showing the overlap of transcripts from the TALON, FLAIR, and pipeline-nanopore-ref-isoforms
GTF files.

These are all of the matched transcripts that were detected in the samples.



The transcripts are matched by GFFcompare, from the gffcmp.tracking output file.
To see how GFFcompare matched the exons please see the "exon matching boxplots".
To see how the graphs are made see the processed venndiagrams notebook.
