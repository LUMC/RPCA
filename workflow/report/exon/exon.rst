GFFcompare matches transcripts based on their exons. Every exon except for the first and last exon of a transcript must exactly match to another transcripts exons to be matched. The start and end exon of a transcript does not have to match in any capacity. These boxplots show the location differences between the start- and end-sites of exons from all matched transcripts from two pipelines at a time.


You are seeing differences at exons after the first exon because not all transcripts have the same number of exons.
